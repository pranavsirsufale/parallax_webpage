        <h1>THE STORY OF LIFE</h1>

            <p>
                Life brings us as many joyful moments as it does downfalls, and although there are days we wish there
                was a manual to follow, it simply wouldn’t be the same without the spontaneity. The journey of life may
                not become easier as we grow older, but we do seem to understand it better as our perspectives evolve.
                Whether you’re embarking on a new adventure right out of school or you want to explore different paths
                in your personal life, it’s never too late to change what the future looks like.Since we as human beings
                developed the ability to think rationally and analyze our surroundings, we have been curious about why
                things are the way that they are.
                Muslims believe that Almighty Allah is the only creator of this world and all other things which are
                present in this world. Everyone in this world thinks about what’s the purpose of our life? Why have we
                been created? Why are we here in this world? As a Muslim we believe that there is only One Creator Who
                created us and we acknowledged Him, we all know that He created us (humankind) to serve Him. Now the
                question comes to mind that How we can serve Him? There is a reason behind the creation of this world
                and humankind. In the Holy Quran, Almighty Allah Almighty mentioned the reason of creation of this world
                that is: “And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is over all things
                competent. Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the
                day are signs for those of understanding.The reason of knowing and understanding of the purpose of life
                and human existence by Muslims is due to the fact that Allah Almighty has given us the book Quran which
                contains all the guidance related to the life of this world. If we want to know about the meaning of
                life then we have to understand it through Holy Quran because all the answers are present in Holy Quran.

        <h1>WHY A REASON ?</h1>
        <p> Everything happens for a reason. From every experience of your life you will see the shadow can't beat the
            sun, sadness can't beat happiness, anger can't beat smile, frustration can't beat patience, hate can't beat
            love, inhumanity can't beat kindness, failure can't beat success.

            <h1>TAKE A COFFEE</h1>
            <p> Why not take a cup of coffee to taste the morning breeze?
                It will let you know that how simple life can create a beautiful moment.
                Don't worry if you feel sad because you can easily find beautiful moments from anywhere.
                Beautiful moments belong to happiness.
